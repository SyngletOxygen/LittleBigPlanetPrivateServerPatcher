[^2]: it is being hosted but only temporarly


### Prequisites:
- Lastest version of java
- Eboot Decrypted on pc.[^3]

[^3]:This shouldnt be a problem in the future, since the goal is to decrypt it on the patcher


# How to run:
Install the lastest version of [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/ie_manual.jsp).
Then you have to simply run the program by downloading it from the [Releases](https://github.com/SyngletOxygen/LittleBigPlanetPrivateServerPatcher/releases) tab. <br />
Select the ´.elf´[^4] file, put the server dns / select it from the server list on the right side of the program, and write the name of the patched elf.[^5]<br />
And if you have done everything right, you shall press "Patch!"

[^4]:this is the file that the Decryptor gives when the file is ... well .... decrypted.
[^5]:this file will be the output of the Patcher, the extension is <FILENAME>.patched. , you can write any folder, if you just write the name of the file, it will get set on the same folder as the patcher.
